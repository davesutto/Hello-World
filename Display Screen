Bought a non-offical 7 inch display.

It's  1024 * 600.   A format not supported by the Pi. 

Loaded Raspian onto the Pi using Noobs. 

The display does not work at all. It does however work fine on a laptop, the the problem is therefore with the PI.

Need to update the Pi to use a standard format that works on the display. 

Amended config.txt using nano.      sudo nano config.txt

set display to 1024 * 768.   The best fit.

hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=16     details on Pi web site

now need to get rid of the extra 168 lines

overscan_bottom=168

For Pi Zero, which has no sound plug socket, sound must be output through the hdmi using:

hdmi_drive=2

WORKS FINE NOW  !!
